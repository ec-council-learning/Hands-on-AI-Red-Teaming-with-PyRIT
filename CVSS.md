# LLM Backdoor Vulnerability Analysis Example

## Vulnerability Classification: Model-Level Persistence

ShadowLogic is a recently discovered technique for creating backdoors in neural network models by manipulating the computational graph representation. This represents a **Model-Level Persistence** vulnerability according to our framework.

## Threat Description

The ShadowLogic technique allows an adversary to implant codeless, surreptitious backdoors in models of any modality by manipulating the computational graph. These backdoors persist through fine-tuning, meaning the model can be hijacked to trigger attacker-defined behavior when a specific trigger input is received.

## CVSS Severity Analysis

### Corrected CVSS Score for LLM ShadowLogic Backdoor:
**Base Score: 8.7 (High)**

| CVSS Component | Rating | Explanation |
|----------------|--------|-------------|
| Attack Vector (AV) | Network (AV:N) | Can be executed remotely through normal interaction channels |
| Attack Complexity (AC) | High (AC:H) | Requires expertise in computational graphs and model architecture |
| Privileges Required (PR) | Low (PR:L) | Requires some level of access to modify the model |
| User Interaction (UI) | None (UI:N) | No user interaction needed once backdoor is implanted |
| Scope (S) | Changed (S:C) | Affects resources beyond the vulnerable component |
| Confidentiality (C) | High (C:H) | Can lead to significant information disclosure |
| Integrity (I) | High (I:H) | Can significantly alter system behavior |
| Availability (A) | Low (A:L) | Some degradation of service possible |

**Vector String: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L**

## Remediation Approach

According to our framework, a Model-Level vulnerability like ShadowLogic requires:

1. **Automated Playbooks for AI Vulnerability Testing**
   - Implement whitebox attack suite with configurable test criteria
   - Conduct continual validation of baselines & monitoring

2. **Documentation & Audit**
   - Create per-model SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)
   - Add to model inventory with proxied offline scanning
   - Make available via CI/CD pipeline

3. **SLA Commitment: 3-7 business days**
   - Detection: Whitebox Attack Suite Testing
   - Required Controls: AI-aware Application Architecture
   - Verification: Customized Kill-Chain & Defense Plans

## Implementation Example

```python
# Example implementation of ShadowLogic detection in model verification pipeline

def verify_model_computational_graph(model_path, report_path):
    """
    Analyze computational graph for potential ShadowLogic backdoors.
    
    Args:
        model_path: Path to the model file
        report_path: Output path for verification report
    
    Returns:
        Boolean indicating whether model passed verification
    """
    # Load model computational graph
    graph = load_computational_graph(model_path)
    
    # Extract graph structure for analysis
    nodes = extract_graph_nodes(graph)
    edges = extract_graph_edges(graph)
    
    # Check for suspicious patterns
    suspicious_patterns = []
    
    # 1. Look for conditional branches that bypass normal execution
    suspicious_patterns.extend(detect_hidden_conditional_paths(nodes, edges))
    
    # 2. Check for nodes that compare inputs against specific values
    suspicious_patterns.extend(detect_trigger_comparisons(nodes))
    
    # 3. Look for nodes that dramatically alter output distribution
    suspicious_patterns.extend(detect_output_manipulations(nodes, edges))
    
    # Generate verification report
    generate_verification_report(
        model_path=model_path,
        report_path=report_path,
        suspicious_patterns=suspicious_patterns,
        verification_status=len(suspicious_patterns) == 0
    )
    
    # Return verification status
    return len(suspicious_patterns) == 0
```

| Regulatory Exposure | Significant - EU AI Act High-Risk Controls |

## Real-World Implications

The ShadowLogic technique demonstrates how traditional security thinking must evolve for AI systems. Unlike software bugs that can be patched, this represents a fundamentally different class of vulnerability:

1. **Persistence Through Fine-tuning**: Standard model improvement techniques do not eliminate the backdoor

2. **Modality-Agnostic**: Can be applied to image, text, or multimodal models

3. **Detection Challenges**: Difficult to detect through black-box testing alone

Organizations deploying AI models should implement comprehensive model governance, including chain of custody validation, secure supply chains, and regular verification testing.
