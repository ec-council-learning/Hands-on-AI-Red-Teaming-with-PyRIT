# Deep Dive: The Evolution of AI Architecture(s)

Stateless to Stateful Systems

## Introduction

This deep dive explores the evolving landscape of AI architectures, focusing on a paradigm shift from purely attention-based systems to increasingly stateful, memory-driven approaches. By examining cutting-edge research from Anthropic and Google, along with emerging trends in model design, we can see how AI systems are evolving to balance computational efficiency with improved reasoning capabilities.

## Computational Graphs as Explanatory Tools

### Attribution Graphs: Understanding AI Biology

Anthropic's research in "On the Biology of a Large Language Model" and "Circuit Tracing: Revealing Computational Graphs in Language Models" (2025) represents a significant advance in our understanding of how large language models function internally. Rather than proposing new architectural designs, this work focuses on developing tools to interpret and explain existing model architectures through the lens of computational graphs.

The Attribution Graph methodology visualizes the internal mechanisms of language models by tracing the flow of information during inference. This approach reveals intricate "circuits" connecting different components within the model, similar to how neuroscientists map neural pathways in biological brains.

Key aspects of this approach include:

1. **Feature Identification**: Isolating interpretable features within model activations that correspond to specific concepts
2. **Cross-Layer Transcoders**: Tools that bridge model layers to create coherent explanations of computation
3. **Causal Attribution**: Mapping how specific inputs directly influence outputs through traced computational paths

What makes this approach particularly valuable is its biological framing. Rather than viewing AI systems as engineered artifacts, the "AI biology" perspective treats them as complex organisms worthy of scientific study. The researchers note: "Like cells form the building blocks of biological systems, we hypothesize that features form the basic units of computation inside models."

By decomposing model operations into these underlying computational graphs, researchers discovered fascinating mechanisms, such as:

- Language models performing explicit arithmetic operations through specialized circuit components
- Persistent "planning" features that activate when generating structured content like poetry
- Evidence that models develop a kind of universal "language of thought" shared across different natural languages

This explanatory approach helps bridge the gap between the black-box nature of large language models and our desire to understand their internal processes, without fundamentally altering their architecture.

## The Configuration vs. State Paradigm Shift

A critical distinction emerging in AI architecture design is between configuration and state:

### Configuration: The Traditional Paradigm

In traditional neural networks, including transformer-based language models, all "knowledge" is encoded in fixed model weights—the configuration. These weights remain constant during inference, with each input processed independently of previous inputs. While models can maintain limited context within a single inference call (via the attention mechanism's access to the current prompt), they have no persistent memory between calls.

Key characteristics of the configuration paradigm include:

1. **Static Weights**: Model parameters remain fixed after training
2. **Ephemeral Context**: Information from prior interactions is lost between inference calls
3. **Limited Window**: Attention operates only within the bounds of the current context window
4. **Immutable Behavior**: Model behavior remains consistent regardless of interaction history

This paradigm has dominated AI for decades, from early neural networks to modern transformers. Its primary advantage is simplicity—models behave predictably and require no persistent state management. However, it significantly limits the ability of models to adapt to users over time or maintain coherent long-term interactions.

### State: The Emerging Paradigm

The emerging paradigm introduces explicit state that persists between inference calls. Rather than encoding all knowledge in fixed weights, these architectures maintain mutable memory that evolves through interaction. This shift enables models to develop persistent "memories" and adapt their behavior based on interaction history.

Key characteristics of the state paradigm include:

1. **Persistent Memory**: Information is stored between inference calls in dedicated memory structures
2. **Adaptive Behavior**: Model responses evolve based on interaction history
3. **Extended Context**: State can maintain information far beyond the limits of attention windows
4. **Personalization**: Systems can develop user-specific adaptations without global model updates

This paradigm shift represents a fundamental rethinking of how AI systems operate, moving from static processing engines to dynamic, adaptive agents that maintain state over time.

## Implementations of Stateful Architectures

### Google's Titans: Memory-Augmented Transformers

Google's Titans architecture (2025) exemplifies the shift toward stateful AI systems. This innovative design combines traditional attention mechanisms with a neural long-term memory module, creating a dual-memory system inspired by human cognition.

Key innovations in the Titans architecture include:

1. **Short-Term Memory**: Traditional attention mechanisms handle immediate context
2. **Long-Term Memory**: A neural memory module stores and retrieves information over extended periods
3. **Adaptive Forgetting**: The system can selectively erase irrelevant information to maintain efficiency

What makes Titans particularly significant is its ability to "learn how to memorize at test time." Unlike traditional models that can only retrieve information within their fixed context window, Titans can dynamically store and recall information across much longer time horizons.

Three variants have been developed, each with different methods of integrating state:

- **Memory as Context (MAC)**: Combines memory with current context for processing
- **Memory as Gating (MAG)**: Uses memory to control information flow
- **Memory as a Layer (MAL)**: Incorporates memory as a distinct processing layer

These approaches allow Titans to efficiently process sequences exceeding two million tokens while maintaining much lower computational requirements than traditional transformers would need for such long contexts.

### Stateful LoRAs: Fine-Tuning with Persistent Memory

Another implementation of the stateful paradigm comes in the form of Neural Graffiti's Stateful LoRA approach. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular technique for efficiently fine-tuning large models by adding small, trainable matrices to frozen model weights. Stateful LoRA extends this concept by adding persistent memory states to these adaptation layers.

Traditional LoRA works by updating only a tiny fraction of model parameters (as low as 0.01%), making fine-tuning much more efficient. Stateful LoRA builds on this foundation by allowing these adaptation layers to maintain and update state between inference calls, enabling:

1. **Continuous Learning**: Models can update their state based on new interactions
2. **User Adaptation**: Systems can evolve personalized behaviors without global model updates
3. **Memory Persistence**: Information can be retained across sessions

This approach represents a particularly elegant implementation of the state paradigm, as it requires minimal architectural changes while still enabling persistent memory capabilities.

## Implications for AI Development

The shift from configuration-based to state-based architectures has profound implications:

### 1. Enhanced Long-Term Reasoning

Stateful architectures can maintain coherent reasoning across much longer time horizons than traditional models. By storing key information in explicit memory structures, these systems can retrieve relevant context even when it occurred thousands or millions of tokens earlier—far beyond the limits of attention-based context windows.

### 2. Personalization Without Global Updates

The state paradigm enables personalization at the individual level without requiring global model updates. Each instance of a model can develop its own persistent state based on user interactions, allowing for customized behaviors while maintaining the base model's general capabilities.

### 3. Reduced Computational Requirements

By separating long-term memory from immediate processing, stateful architectures can achieve much greater efficiency when handling long contexts. Instead of processing the entire context with expensive attention mechanisms, these systems can selectively store and retrieve only the most relevant information.

### 4. Evolution of Model Behavior

Perhaps most significantly, stateful models can evolve their behavior over time based on experience. This creates the possibility of systems that develop unique "personalities" or interaction patterns through extended use—a significant step toward more human-like AI.

## Conclusion

The evolution from purely configuration-based architectures to stateful systems represents one of the most significant shifts in AI design in recent years. By incorporating persistent memory components, these new architectures are moving beyond the limitations of traditional models while maintaining their core strengths.

As this trend continues to develop, we can expect increasingly sophisticated AI systems that maintain coherent state, develop personalized behaviors, and reason over much longer time horizons—moving us closer to truly adaptive, context-aware artificial intelligence.

The next frontier in this evolution involves "Just in Time" localization of models, code, and prompts—a paradigm that further extends the stateful approach by dynamically adapting not just memory but entire computational components based on specific contexts and needs.
