# Foundations of AI Red Teaming: Hands-on w/ PyRIT

**AUTHOR**: [David Pierce, MPA](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidisaacpierce/)

**DURATION**: 3 Hours

### OVERVIEW

AI systems are rapidly being deployed across industries, yet many organizations lack the security expertise to properly test them. This hands-on course teaches you practical AI red teaming skills using Microsoft's PyRIT framework - the same tools used by leading AI security teams. You'll learn proven methodologies and techniques for systematically testing AI systems, identifying vulnerabilities, and helping make AI deployments more secure.

### TARGET AUDIENCE

This course is for you if you're a security professional, developer, or IT practitioner who wants to build practical skills in AI security testing. You should have basic Python programming experience and familiarity with general security concepts. No prior AI/ML security knowledge is required - we'll teach you everything you need to know about testing modern AI systems.

### KEY FEATURES

* Learn professional AI red teaming techniques using Microsoft's PyRIT framework through hands-on labs and real-world examples
* Master proven methodologies for systematically discovering and exploiting AI vulnerabilities including prompt injection, jailbreaking, and data extraction
* Build practical skills in orchestrating complex attack chains, measuring security posture, and creating actionable security reports for AI systems

### APPROACH

This course focuses on hands-on learning with real-world examples. Each section combines clear conceptual explanations with guided lab exercises using PyRIT. You'll progress from basic concepts to advanced techniques, with plenty of opportunities to practice and experiment. Code examples include detailed comments explaining key concepts.
